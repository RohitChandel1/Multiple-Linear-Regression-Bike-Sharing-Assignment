## Problem Overview
A bike-sharing system allows users to access bikes for short-term use, typically for a fee or free of charge. In response to the challenging market conditions caused by the ongoing pandemic, a US-based bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, seeks to revitalize its revenue streams. The company aims to understand the demand for shared bikes post-lockdown and enhance its business strategy accordingly. The goal is to stand out from competitors and maximize profits.

## Business Objective
BoomBikes aims to comprehend the factors influencing bike demand in the American market. The company has enlisted a consulting firm to identify significant variables affecting demand and to gauge how well these variables explain bike demands. The objective is to provide insights that enable the company to adapt its business strategy effectively, meet customer expectations, and understand the demand dynamics in a post-lockdown scenario.

## Data and Dictionary
The dataset, located in the 'datasets' folder, includes 'day.csv' (the dataset) and 'Readme.txt' (the data dictionary). The data encompasses daily bike demand in the American market, considering various meteorological surveys and lifestyle factors.
